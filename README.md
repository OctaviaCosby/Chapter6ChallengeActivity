Hello,
My name is Octavia I am currently a student at Florida Atlantic University and enrolled in COP 3813-002 (Introduction to Internet Computing)
In this project we will be diving into the intricate ways to creat a simple web-based calculator with scientific functions. 
HTML, JS and CSS are utilized in this project. While ChatGPT by OpenAI was also used for the structure of the calculator additional style and design was created by me.
Moving forward I may be adding different functions to the calculator including but not limited to fractions, mutlple memories within the calculator and even unit conversions.

Platforms used to create this calculator:
- Visual Studio Code
- ChatGPT by OpenAI
